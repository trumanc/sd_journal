Sleep Journal App project for Psych 135: Sleep and Dreams

This Android app is a class project. It will allow users to record data about sleep and alertness 
using their phone, then analyze it after several weeks of data have been collected. The particular
data collected is defined by the Sleep Journal Project in the class.

The app will also allow users to email a weekly data summary to a TA (and themselves for data backup),
and (hopefully) will display graphs analyzing the data at the end of 7 weeks.
